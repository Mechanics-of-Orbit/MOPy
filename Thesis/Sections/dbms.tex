\subsection{Introduction}
Database is a collection of set of related data or information of any particular concept, generally stored using any electronic gadget . Database Management system is a system which uses integrated software to connect frontend user to connect to the database to access , modify and manage the data stored in it.  
There are two types of Databases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Relational Database - Organizes data into one or more table. each table comprising of number of rows and columns  with each row identifiable with unique key.
\item Non - Relational database - Organizes data in any form other than table. Such as graphs, flexible tables, documents etc.
\end{enumerate}
In this project we have used Relational database management system with structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with the RDBMS. SQLite is the database engine used to run SQL query to perform CRUD ( Create , Retrieve, Update or Delete) operation in the database.

This database contains the data of planetary bodies such as Mass, radius, density, gravity, temperature, orbital parameters, number of moons etc., of all planets of our solar system.
